*DESCRIPTION*: This project is a simple Inventory Management System built using Flask for the backend and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. It provides a user-friendly interface to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on inventory items stored in an SQLite database. The RESTful API handles all backend logic using Flask routes and SQLAlchemy, while the frontend communicates asynchronously using JavaScript's Fetch API. The system is lightweight, easy to run locally, and ideal for beginners learning how to connect frontend and backend applications. It includes a requirements.txt file for setting up dependencies and excludes the virtual environment from version control, promoting clean project management.
